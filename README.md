# ðŸŽ® Rock, Paper, Scissors â€“ My First JavaScript Project

This project is my first step into JavaScript, following The Odin Project web development course. Here, I apply my newly acquired skills by building a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
Enjoy the game and feel free to explore the code! ðŸš€
